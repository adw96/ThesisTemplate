An empty template for a Cornell PhD dissertation.

This template is based on the final Thesis.tex file of a Cornell PhD student who graduated 2 years ago. It is available here for the sole purpose of helping my fellow graduate students to start their dissertations in the least stressful manner possible. Please note that I am not the author of the style file and claim no credit nor responsibility for it.

This template is by no means submission-ready; none of the requirements of the Graduate School have been verified. 

This document is provided “as is”, though I very much hope that it helps you.
